1) 
Title : A pop up window with a message i.e "Please make a deposit to activate your account" is always opening when I click on any feature and also not given close option at title bar.
Effect: if a user wants to sign up for the first time to explore the website how it works. but if the user is getting the pop-up window every time then the user
may be irritated and can leave the website.
Suggestion: I feel that if a user wants to play a game if the user selects any game to play at that time the user should get a pop up to activate the account. 
But not every time when he selects any other features like customer service.


2)
Title : In contact us page.there is mismatch of email ids.
Contact our support mail id is given "se.support@videoslots.com"
But in contact information its given "see.support@videoslots.com"
Effect: Users will not be able to send mail for any inquiry or issues.
Suggestion: Both the email ids should be the same.otherwise user won't be able to send mail.
